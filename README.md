This is a read-only unofficial mirror of the [OpenGrm NGram Library](http://opengrm.org/NGramLibrary).

This is simply a mirror of recent OpenGrm NGram Library releases, for convenience. The OpenGrm NGram Library was not developed here, the project is not active here, it does not accept pull requests here, and there is no issue tracker or wiki here. For all of these things, the [OpenGrm NGram Library project home](http://opengrm.org/NGramLibrary) is the best place to go.
